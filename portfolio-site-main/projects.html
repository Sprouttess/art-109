          <h3>"Silence, 2021"</h3>
          <p>In this art piece, I used photoshop to create something basic into something more eye-catching. I took an old photo of myself with a snapchat filter from years ago and used masks and layers to create a kind of scary/horror theme creature. Through the creating process, I wanted to eliminate any elements that made me look human or normal. I took away my eyes and mouth, even changed my head shape a little. The glitch effect was from the filter which started the inspiration. It’s like something trying to break out of the TV and into reality, almost like “The Ring” girl as she crawls out from the TV screen. With the final render created, I realized that it looks similar to the creature in the series Dr Who called The Silence. The Silence was this ghostly alien-like creature with no mouth or eyes and just a nose. If you saw it, you would instantly forget its existence and that it was in the same room as you.</p>

          <h3>"Jedi Lightsabers, 2021"</h3>
          <p>In Blender, I made 2 custom lightsabers from Star Wars. I used many tools like extruding, beveling, and scaling to help give shape to the forms of the hilts. After reviewing, small adjustments, and applying color, I created 2 final renders of the project (intense and calm). The final result was alright but dull. So I took them to photoshop and overlaid some effects to give off some kind of cinematic feel. Growing up, Star Wars was a big thing that I liked. The characters, the designs, the sound, they were something cool and unreal to experience. After seeing this stuff, I always wanted to make my own version of how they looked. Making this was so special because not only was it connected to my childhood, but it made me very proud to achieve something that I was able to create from it. For a while, it was a dream for me to make something star wars related but also look very good.</p>

          Doughmania. The little Doughmans are in crumbles. Made from Blender.</p>
